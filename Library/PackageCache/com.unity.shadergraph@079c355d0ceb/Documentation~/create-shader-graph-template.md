# Create a new shader graph from a template

To create a shader graph from a template, use the Template Browser window. You can then adapt the shader graph to your needs.

You can also share custom templates with your team through the Template Browser window, to maintain consistency across shaders in a project. This feature is particularly useful for projects with unique lighting setups or specific shader requirements.
