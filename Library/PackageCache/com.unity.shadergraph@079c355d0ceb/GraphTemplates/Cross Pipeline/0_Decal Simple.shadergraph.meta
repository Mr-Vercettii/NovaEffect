    description: 'A simple decal template that projects a color image along the Y
      axis of the decal. This simple decal does not modify the smoothness, normals,
      metallic, or ambient occlusion properties of the material. If you want to change
      those, you''ll need to add additional features to the shader.


      In order
      to use decals in URP, you''ll need to add the Decal Renderer Feature to URP''s
      Renderer Data asset. In HDRP, decals work automatically so no settings changes
      are required.


      In both render pipelines, you can add a decal to your
      scene by right-clicking in your scene''s Hierarchy panel and selecting Rendering->HDRP
      (or URP) Decal Projector. Then select the new Decal Projector and assign it
      a material that uses your Shader Graph asset.
