    description: 'A decal template that projects a material from the top, side, and
      front using triplanar projection. Works great for blending terrain materials
      onto other objects. Angle fade is not enabled in this shader because it projects
      correctly at any angle.


      In order to use decals in URP, you''ll need
      to add the Decal Renderer Feature to URP''s Renderer Data asset. In HDRP, decals
      work automatically so no settings changes are required.


      In both render
      pipelines, you can add a decal to your scene by right-clicking in your scene''s
      Hierarchy panel and selecting Rendering->HDRP (or URP) Decal Projector. Then
      select the new Decal Projector and assign it a material that uses your Shader
      Graph asset.
