    name: Lit Full
    category: Basics
    description: 'A complex shader that closely mimics the functionality of URP''s
      Lit shader (the code version). Any material using URP''s Lit shader can easily
      swap to this Shader Graph version and all of the parameters will remain the
      same. Then you can make modifications to the functionality of this shader in
      Shader Graph as needed.


      If you like the URP Lit shader but just want
      to add one thing, or you wish you could remove some things to make it faster,
      this template is a great place to start.



      This template uses the same
      Custom Editor GUI as URP''s Lit shader. This means that the material GUI is
      dependent on the specific set of parameters it''s using. If you''re planning
      to remove or change parameters in the Blackboard, you may want to also remove
      the reference to the Custom Editor GUI so that parameters will appear and work
      as intended.
