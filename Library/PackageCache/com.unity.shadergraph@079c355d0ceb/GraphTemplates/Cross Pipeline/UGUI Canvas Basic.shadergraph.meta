    description: 'A basic template that can be assigned to UGUI canvas objects for
      creating user interface shaders.


      User interface shaders can be used
      to create interactable elements such as buttons or sliders. They can also be
      used for indicators or background elements in the user interface.


      For
      more detailed examples of UGUI shaders, import the UGUI Shaders Sample from
      the Shader Graph package in Package Manager.
