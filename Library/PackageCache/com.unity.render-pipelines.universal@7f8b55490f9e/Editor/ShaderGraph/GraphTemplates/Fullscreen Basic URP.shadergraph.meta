    description: 'A URP Shader Graph template that does simple fullscreen image adjustments
      including tinting, saturation, and contrast.


      Fullscreen shaders are
      intended to be used to apply image adjustments for applications like post-process
      filters. They are not intended to be applied to individual meshes.


      To
      apply a fullscreen shader as a post-process filter, select URP''s renderer
      data asset and click the Add Renderer Feature button at the bottom of the Inspector.
      Choose Full Screen Pass Renderer Feature. Then create a material from your
      fullscreen shader and apply it to the Pass Material slot of the Full Screen
      Pass Renderer Feature.



      Supported Pipeline(s): URP
